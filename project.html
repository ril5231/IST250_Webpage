            <h2>Characteristics of effective graphical displays</h2>
            <h6 class="w3-padding-32">Professor Edward Tufte explained that users of information displays are executing particular analytical tasks such as making comparisons or determining causality. The design principle of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.<br>
            In his 1983 book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Edward Tufte defines 'graphical displays' and principles for effective graphical display in the following passage: "Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Graphical displays should:</h6>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
            1. show the data<br>
            2. induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else<br>
            3. avoid distorting what the data has to say<br>
            4. present many numbers in a small space<br>
            5. make large data sets coherent<br>
            6. encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data<br>
            7. reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a  broad overview to the fine structure<br>
            8. serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration<br>
            9. be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.<br></p>

            <h2>Why your brain need data visualization? </h2>
            <h6 class="w3-padding-32">If you tried to picture each individual data value that is being generated just in your company, your head would spin. The human brain is incapable of processing more than one value at a time let alone hundreds, thousands, millions or billions. Yet, information can inform and enlighten your business practices, direction and vision. Fortunately, there is something to help your brain not only imagine your corporate information, but consume it. Enter data visualization.<br>
            Data visualization is the representation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. The purpose of data visualization is to simplify data values, promote the understanding of them, and communicate important concepts and ideas. Visualizations are the single easiest way for our brains to receive and interpret large amounts of information. Data visualization gives business users the ability to use information intuitively, without deep technical expertise. Even novice users can create data visualizations that are meaningful, such as pie charts, line graphs, bubble charts and heat maps.<br>
            Advanced data visualizations support more in-depth and complex analytics. A visual tier that sits on top of the analytics program lets users view the results of complex algorithmic processing. Not only can they get insight into what’s happened, they can forecast what might happen, using rich graphics to quickly derive business actions. The fact is, when people transition from spreadsheets to data visuals, they are able to register the values they are seeing as a whole.</h6>
            
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Mobile applications for tablets increase the sharing and dissemination of data visuals among business users. Web-based applications unchain us from traditional desktop applications and encourage mobility. Managers, account representatives and executives can all access visual reports and see key performance indicators from anywhere. Having a centralized access point for important reports and indicators minimizes the endless paper and email trails that often result in miscommunication and misinformation.<br>
            There is no going back. The flow of data will not shrink in the near future; in fact, it will continue to grow exponentially. Time is doing us no favors, and we may not always have access to or the resources for all the technical experts that we think we need. Today we can use data visualizations and the advanced analytics that supports them to meet these challenges head on.
